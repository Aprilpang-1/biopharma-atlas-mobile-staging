  // top (-50 -> -70) so Cardiovascular's line can move up again (y:-20 ->
  // y:-55) while Vaccines/Infectious Disease's own top run drops low
  // enough (y:55 -> y:15) to clear JAK/Integrin/FcRn Inhibitor's label

  // unit gap between them.

  // overflow:hidden fix on #subway-map - the CSS 'overflow' property's
  // behavior on a root/outermost <svg> is genuinely inconsistent across
  // browsers, so relying on it alone wasn't reliable. This is a second,
  // SVG-native clip that doesn't depend on that CSS behavior at all: a
  // <clipPath> matching the viewBox rectangle.
  //
  // 2026-08-07: April saw the sun/road overshoot again on mobile Safari
  // (turning the city background back on for phones - see the .city-bg
  // mobile media-query removal - made this visible there for the first
  // time). Applying clip-path directly to the ROOT <svg> element (as this
  // did before) is a less-common pattern than clipping a child <g> -
  // several WebKit/Safari versions have had inconsistent support for
  // clip-path on the outermost svg specifically. Now every piece of map
  // content (background, city art, lines, stations, badges, legend) is
  // appended to an inner <g id="map-content"> instead, with the clip-path
  // on THAT group - clipping a normal child element is the well-supported,
  // conventional use of SVG clip-path, so this doesn't depend on the
  // root-svg edge case at all. Belt-and-suspenders with the CSS

// Single consolidated legend box (bottom-left, like a real transit map's
// corner legend) mapping every abbreviation shown on the map to its full
// area name - since the map itself now only shows abbreviations inline.
// Legend box scale - April compared Current/Medium/Large against the real
// map (animated preview) and picked Medium (1.35x), then asked for the box
// itself to go up to 1.5x. Anchored to the same bottom-right corner margin
// the box has always used (20px from the map's right edge, 10px from the
// bottom), growing up-and-left as it scales.
//
// 2026-08-04: two things fixed/changed together here. (1) the title/badge-
// letter/area-name font sizes used to be hardcoded static CSS px values
// (18.9/12.15/13.5, i.e. baked in for the old 1.35 scale) instead of being
// computed from LEGEND_SCALE like the box/circle geometry already was -
// that's why bumping the scale grew the box and swatch circles but left
// the text sizes frozen. Font sizes are now set inline from LEGEND_SCALE
// so everything grows together. (2) April specifically asked for the
// badge (swatch circle) and its letters to be bigger than a plain
// proportional bump would give, so those two use larger base constants
// than the title/name text (14/10, unchanged base - just newly
// proportional). Went through several rounds landing on +15% for the
// badge circle (10->11.5) with the box kept at the first-boost size
// (h-base 160, row height tightened to 24*s to fit without rows
// overlapping). The letter size was tried at a 5% reduction from +15%
// first (14.2) but "ON" still crowded the circle's edge, so it was
// dropped further to 10.5 - checked against the widest 2-letter
// abbreviation (MB), not just ON, so every badge has real margin.
